--1. Load the given dataset into snowflake with a primary key to Order Date column
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE AS_SALES_DATA_FINAL
(
    order_id VARCHAR(20),
    order_date DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    ship_date DATE,
    ship_mode CHAR(20),

    order_priority CHAR(10),
    order_year int 
);

DESC TABLE AS_SALES_DATA_FINAL;
SELECT * FROM AS_SALES_DATA_FINAL;

--2. Change the Primary key to Order Id Column.
ALTER TABLE AS_SALES_DATA_FINAL
DROP PRIMARY KEY;

ALTER TABLE AS_SALES_DATA_FINAL
ADD PRIMARY KEY(order_id);


--3. Check the data type for Order date and Ship date and mention in what data type 
--it should be?
/*Data type changed in csv file using formula DATE(RIGHT(B5149,4),LEFT(B5149,1),MID(B5149,3,2))
and loaded the Order date and Ship date with data type as DATE.*/

--4. Create a new column called order_extract and extract the number after the last 
--‘–‘from Order ID column.

SELECT order_id ,RIGHT(ORDER_ID,(LENGTH(ORDER_ID)-8)) AS order_extract FROM AS_SALES_DATA_FINAL;

--5. Create a new column called Discount Flag and categorize it based on discount. 
--Use ‘Yes’ if the discount is greater than zero else ‘No’.

SELECT discount,
       CASE WHEN DISCOUNT > 0 THEN 'YES'
            ELSE 'No'
            END AS Discount_Flag
FROM AS_SALES_DATA_FINAL;

--6. Create a new column called process days and calculate how many days it takes 
--for each order id to process from the order to its shipment.

SELECT order_date,ship_date,DATEDIFF(day,order_date,ship_date) AS Days_to_Process_Order FROM AS_SALES_DATA_FINAL;  

/*7. Create a new column called Rating and then based on the Process dates give 
rating like given below.
a. If process days less than or equal to 3days then rating should be 5
b. If process days are greater than 3 and less than or equal to 6 then rating 
should be 4
c. If process days are greater than 6 and less than or equal to 10 then rating 
should be 3
d. If process days are greater than 10 then the rating should be 2.*/

SELECT   
    order_date,ship_date,DATEDIFF(day,order_date,ship_date) AS Days_to_Process_Order,
    CASE WHEN Days_to_Process_Order <= 3 THEN 5
         WHEN Days_to_Process_Order <= 6 AND Days_to_Process_Order > 3 THEN 4
         WHEN Days_to_Process_Order < 10 AND Days_to_Process_Order > 6 THEN 3
         WHEN Days_to_Process_Order > 10 THEN 2
     END AS Rating
